# Carpool App 
### Developed for Hack TX 2018

Problem: Large organizations who want to set up events off-campus often have difficulty arranging carpools. Sometimes, cars leave with empty seats and others are full to the brim. Other times, drivers have to pick up people across town while other drivers could have picked up these riders easily. 

Goal: We want to take off the weight of planning these carpools on these organizations by automating the process.  

Solution: Create an app that lets users sign up as a rider or driver and automatically decide cars and send out alerts once the selection is over.

### How it works
Our Carpool App creates clusters where organizers are able to organize a car pool, send the link to the pool to different people, then those different people would specify if they can go, what music they prefer, and what their pickup location will be.

### Technology used
React.js
Go
Node.js
C#

We are using a microservices architecture where each microservice communicates with a boundary gate way that sends and receives data from the front end which is using React. We are using MongoDB for our database because most of the data is unstructured and it was easy to make database mutations as our requirements changed.
